1. Bangkok Metropolitan Region
The Bangkok Metropolitan Region (BMR) is by far the most dominant region in Thailand’s Disabled and Elderly Assistive Device Market. As the capital city and economic hub of Thailand, Bangkok accounts for a substantial share of the market due to its population size, high-income levels, and urbanized healthcare infrastructure. With over 10 million people residing in the metropolitan area, a significant proportion of the population falls into the elderly and disabled categories. According to the World Bank, Thailand’s elderly population is expected to reach nearly 20% by 2030, with a significant concentration in Bangkok.

The city is home to numerous healthcare facilities, rehabilitation centers, and specialized medical professionals who cater to the needs of the elderly and disabled. This makes Bangkok a key driver for the market, as individuals in this region have greater access to assistive devices and healthcare services. Additionally, the government’s initiatives to improve accessibility for people with disabilities, such as the construction of more accessible public transportation systems and improved public infrastructure, further drive demand for assistive devices.

By 2030, the BMR is expected to see a surge in demand for advanced mobility aids, hearing aids, visual aids, and cognitive support technologies as the aging population grows. Technological innovations, such as smart hearing aids, robotic mobility aids, and wearable devices, are expected to be widely adopted in this region, cementing Bangkok’s position as a dominant force in the market.

2. Chiang Mai
Chiang Mai, the largest city in northern Thailand, has experienced significant economic and healthcare development in recent years. As one of Thailand's most popular tourist destinations, Chiang Mai also has a growing population of elderly citizens, especially retirees. The city’s medical tourism industry is thriving, and healthcare facilities in Chiang Mai cater to both local residents and international patients, many of whom are elderly or disabled.

The demand for assistive devices in Chiang Mai is driven by the region's growing elderly population. The city is home to various healthcare providers and rehabilitation centers specializing in elderly care, making it a key market for assistive technology. Chiang Mai’s healthcare sector is increasingly embracing new technologies to improve patient outcomes, and as a result, there has been a notable increase in the adoption of devices such as motorized wheelchairs, hearing aids, and walking aids.

By 2030, Chiang Mai’s position as a medical hub for northern Thailand will make it a central player in the disabled and elderly assistive device market. The increasing number of elderly residents and the rising demand for specialized care are expected to fuel growth in the assistive device sector. Furthermore, the city’s focus on eco-tourism and sustainable practices will likely drive the development of assistive devices that are both functional and environmentally friendly.

3. Chonburi and Pattaya
Chonburi, along with its famous coastal city of Pattaya, represents another dominant region in Thailand’s Disabled and Elderly Assistive Device Market. Known for its vibrant tourism industry, Chonburi attracts a significant number of elderly expatriates, many of whom settle in the region for its affordable cost of living and warm climate. This influx of elderly retirees is a primary driver of the market for assistive devices.

In addition to a growing elderly population, Chonburi is home to numerous medical facilities and rehabilitation centers that cater to both local and foreign patients. The region has witnessed a surge in healthcare infrastructure development, particularly in Pattaya, which has earned a reputation as a hub for medical tourism. As the region continues to attract retirees and elderly expatriates, the demand for hearing aids, mobility aids, and other assistive devices will continue to grow.

4. Nakhon Ratchasima (Korat)
Nakhon Ratchasima, commonly known as Korat, is located in northeastern Thailand and is one of the country’s fastest-growing regions. The city has become a center of economic activity for the northeastern region and has seen significant infrastructure development in recent years. With a rising elderly population in the area, Nakhon Ratchasima is increasingly becoming an important market for assistive devices.

While the region is not as developed as Bangkok or Chiang Mai in terms of healthcare services, it is witnessing rapid improvements in healthcare facilities, especially in elderly care. As the city continues to expand, demand for assistive devices such as hearing aids, wheelchair ramps, and personal mobility aids is expected to grow.

The region is known for its growing healthcare infrastructure, including hospitals and rehabilitation centers that cater to the elderly and disabled.

The demand for assistive devices in Songkhla and Hat Yai is driven by the region’s aging population and the growing awareness of the need for accessible healthcare solutions. As more people seek specialized care for hearing, mobility, and cognitive issues, the market for assistive devices in this region is expected to see steady growth. The southern provinces of Thailand have traditionally lagged behind in terms of healthcare accessibility, but with increasing investment in healthcare services, Songkhla and Hat Yai are poised to become key players in the assistive device market by 2030.
